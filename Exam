## Markup Languages
Markup languages provide pre-defined, parsable syntax within text documents that is used for annotations. 
Python supports a variety of modules to work with various forms of structured data markup.
 This includes modules to work with the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML),
  and several interfaces for working with the Extensible Markup Language (XML).
  Markup language is similar to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) made of Markup tags, and it consists of the opening tag and closing tag .
